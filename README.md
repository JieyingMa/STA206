# STA206 - Statistical Methods for Research I

## Abalone Age Prediction Using Statistical Modeling (R)

- Conducted exploratory data analysis on a dataset of 4,177 abalones with nine variables (e.g., length, weight, rings) to understand feature distributions and relationships with age.
- Developed regression models to predict abalone age, using AIC and BIC for model selection, VIF to test for multicollinearity, and, after testing assumptions, added higher-order terms and applied log transformation to improve model fit.
- Achieved a significant improvement in prediction accuracy, reducing MSE from 129.85 to 4.54, without overfitting.
